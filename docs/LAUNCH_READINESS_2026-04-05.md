# VaultLister 3.0 — Launch Readiness Report
**Date:** 2026-04-05 | **Method:** Chrome walkthrough (35+ pages / 70 available) + 2x codebase audit (automated scan)
**Launch Scope:** Canada only | **Platforms:** eBay, Poshmark, Facebook, Depop, Whatnot
**Post-Launch:** Mercari, Grailed, Etsy, Shopify (Coming Soon)

---

## CRITICAL (Must fix before launch)

| # | Issue | Source | Details |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| CR-1 | Auth lockout bypassed | Code audit | `checkLoginAttempts()` in auth.js:105-107 always returns `{locked: false}` — brute force unprotected |
| CR-2 | OAUTH_MODE defaults to 'mock' | Code audit | If not set in Railway .env, all platform integrations use fake tokens. 32 files reference this |
| CR-3 | Stripe not configured | Chrome | "Upgrade to Pro" / "Upgrade to Business" buttons will fail. No STRIPE_PRICE_ID_* set |
| CR-4 | Shipping integration incomplete | Code audit | Uses deprecated Shippo, not EasyPost. EasyPost API key under anti-fraud review |
| ~~CR-5~~ | ~~No eBay bot for cross-listing~~ | Code audit | eBay uses OAuth REST API (`ebayPublish.js` / `ebaySync.js`) — no Playwright bot needed; `ebay-bot.js` deleted — **NOT A BLOCKER** |
| CR-6 | Hardcoded fake data in Market Intel | Chrome | "Vintage Denim HOT 92", "Designer Bags HOT 87", "vintage levis 2.4k +15%" — all hardcoded |
| CR-7 | Fake Getting Started progress | Chrome | Help page shows 2/5 steps complete (40%) for brand new users who haven't done anything |
| CR-8 | Fake article view counts | Chrome | Help page shows "1,240 views", "980 views" etc — no real KB exists |
| CR-9 | Sales Funnel "Views 50" hardcoded | Chrome | Analytics page shows hardcoded funnel data |
| CR-10 | Platform OAuth not wired | Chrome | All 9 "Connect" buttons on My Shops — none have working OAuth flows |

## HIGH (Should fix before launch)

| # | Issue | Source | Details |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| H-1 | 100+ Math.random() fallbacks in app.js | Code audit | Fake health scores, prices, percentages throughout if data missing |
| H-2 | All dollar amounts show "$" not "C$" | Chrome | Dashboard, Orders, Offers, Financials, Analytics — all use US dollar symbol |
| H-3 | Coming Soon platforms not marked | Chrome | Mercari/Grailed/Etsy/Shopify show active "Connect" buttons — should be "Coming Soon" |
| H-4 | Shipping Labels button enabled but broken | Chrome | Yellow CTA on Orders page — EasyPost not built, clicking will fail |
| H-5 | MFA (#13) still absent | Chrome | Settings shows "Enable" 2FA button — does it actually work? STATUS.md says Fail |
| H-6 | Dashboard massive empty space on scroll | Chrome | Scrolling past dashboard widgets shows huge white void with sidebar detached |
| H-7 | "$30/hr" rate hardcoded in Automations | Chrome | "Est. at $30/hr" — should be C$ and user-configurable |
| H-8 | Pricing shows USD ($19/$49) not CAD | Chrome | Plans & Billing shows US pricing for Canadian launch |
| H-9 | "Upgrade to Premium" vs "Upgrade to Pro" inconsistency | Chrome | Top button says "Premium", cards say "Pro" and "Business" |
| H-10 | Rate limiting disabled in production | Code audit | rateLimiter.js:27 has TODO: "disabled during development/testing" |
| H-11 | Login page gradient seam | Chrome | Blue gradient stops at ~75% width — white strip on right edge |
| H-12 | No SKU unique constraint in live DB | Code audit | Migration 004 exists but may not be applied |
| H-13 | Automation "83% Success Rate" stale data | Chrome | Shows test run data from development — confusing for new users |

## MEDIUM (Important but not blocking)

| # | Issue | Source | Details |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| M-1 | "100% Listing Health" at 0 listings | Chrome | Should show N/A when there's nothing to score |
| M-2 | Market Trends Radar labels truncated | Chrome | "intage" (Vintage), "Electron" (Electronics) cut off |
| M-3 | "0% Avg Offer" when 0 offers exist | Chrome | Should show N/A, not 0% |
| M-4 | Financial score "30" with no data | Chrome | Should be 0 or N/A, not an arbitrary default |
| M-5 | "Consider optimizing costs" with no data | Chrome | Irrelevant advice for empty-state users |
| M-6 | "Profit margin below target (15%)" | Chrome | Analytics shows warning with no sales data |
| M-7 | Green "0.0%" up arrows on empty data | Chrome | KPI cards show green up arrow when there's no prior data to compare |
| M-8 | Timezone defaults to Eastern, not user's | Chrome | Should auto-detect or default to MST for Calgary launch |
| M-9 | Orders "More" button truncated | Chrome | "Mo..." cut off at right edge |
| M-10 | "Your items: 89" hardcoded in Market Intel | Chrome | Should reflect actual inventory count |
| M-11 | Dashboard "$2,000 goal" hardcoded | Chrome | Monthly Goal defaults to $2,000 — should be user-set or hidden |
| M-12 | Keyboard shortcut shows ⌘K (Mac) on Windows | Chrome | Help search bar shows Mac shortcut |
| M-13 | Image Bank 5GB limit — real or hardcoded? | Chrome | "5.00 GB free" — is this actual R2 limit? |
| M-14 | Plans "Cross-list to 3 platforms" confusing | Chrome | Free plan says 3, but only 5 available at launch. Pro says "all 9" but 4 are Coming Soon |

## LOW (Polish items)

| # | Issue | Source | Details |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| L-1 | No "show password" toggle on login | Chrome | Minor UX improvement |
| L-2 | Green dot (WS indicator) on login page | Chrome | Should be hidden on unauthenticated pages |
| L-3 | "Not yet refreshed" text on dashboard | Chrome | First-time users see stale data warning |
| L-4 | "Good afternoon, demo!" uses username | Chrome | Should prefer display_name or full_name |
| L-5 | "Low Stock" card highlights at 0 | Chrome | Yellow highlight on inventory stat card when value is 0 |
| L-6 | "Stale (90+ days)" label wraps | Chrome | Text wraps to two lines in stat card |
| L-7 | "Full Name" empty in settings | Chrome | Registration doesn't collect full name |
| L-8 | "Contact support to change email" — no support channel | Chrome | Is there a support email or form? |
| L-9 | Vault Buddy chat bubble occludes content | Chrome | Bottom-right bubble covers "Net" label in financials, "Goal" in analytics |
| L-10 | Console.log statements in production | Code audit | ~10 instances in error handlers |
| L-11 | Fake 555-xxxx phone numbers in supplier data | Code audit | FCC reserved range, obviously fake |
| L-12 | "Competitor Activity — Live Activity" with no data | Chrome | Green dot suggests live feed that doesn't exist |

## COSMETIC

| # | Issue | Source | Details |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| CO-1 | Green up arrows on 0% changes | Chrome | Should be neutral/gray when no comparison data |
| CO-2 | Financial score 30 color (red) | Chrome | Arbitrary default looks alarming |
| CO-3 | "Updated Just now" in Market Intel | Chrome | Misleading when no data fetched |

| MEDIUM | 14 |
| LOW | 12 |
| COSMETIC | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | **52** |

## TOP 10 PRIORITY FIXES FOR LAUNCH

1. **Fix checkLoginAttempts()** — implement real brute force protection

5. **Change all "$" to "C$"** — global currency localization for Canada
6. **Mark Mercari/Grailed/Etsy/Shopify as "Coming Soon"** on My Shops
7. **Configure Stripe** — set STRIPE_PRICE_ID_* for CAD pricing
8. **Disable or hide Shipping Labels button** until EasyPost integration ready
9. **Fix Plans pricing** — show CAD amounts, fix "Premium" vs "Pro" inconsistency
10. **Fix login page gradient** — CSS extends to full viewport width

### MEDIUM (new findings)

| # | Page | Issue |
|---|------|-------|
| M-15 | Register | Sidebar visible on register page — should be hidden for unauth views |

| M-17 | Transactions | "$0 / $999" filter defaults in USD |
| M-18 | Transactions | "All Categorie" dropdown text truncated — missing 's' |
| M-19 | Roadmap | "No features found" — should have planned features pre-populated |
| M-20 | Affiliate | "$50 Minimum Payout" in USD not CAD |

| # | Page | Issue |
|---|------|-------|
| L-13 | Register | No Full Name or Display Name field in registration |
| L-14 | Refer a Friend | Referral code "VAULTDEMO" hardcoded — should be user-specific |

| L-18 | Connections | Gmail/Outlook/Cloudinary/Google Drive "Connect" buttons — are these functional? |
| L-19 | Dashboard | Massive empty space below widgets on scroll — layout/height issue |

### COSMETIC (new findings)

| # | Page | Issue |
|---|------|-------|
| CO-4 | Register | Password requirement checkmarks not validated live as user types |
| CO-5 | Whatnot Live | Green "0% vs last week" arrows — should be neutral |

## PASS 3 — Remaining Pages + Dark Mode + Interaction Testing

### Pages Tested in Pass 3 (26 new)
teams, webhooks, reportBug, suggestFeatures, feedbackSuggestions, supportArticles, tutorials, checklist, recentlyDeleted, shippingProfiles, skuRules, reportBuilder, arPreview, resetPassword, emailVerification, verifyEmail, errorPage, pushNotifications, feedbackAnalytics, help, privacy (in-app), privacyPolicy (in-app), termsOfService (in-app), privacy.html (public)

### New Findings

| # | Sev | Page | Issue |
|---|-----|------|-------|
| CR-16 | CRITICAL | Predictions | Entire page is 100% hardcoded fake data — 6 fake items with fake prices, fake AI confidence 77%/87%/82%/75%, fake trend charts |
| H-20 | HIGH | Feedback & Suggestions | "Top Contributor — top 10%" badge shown to user with 0 submissions |
| H-21 | HIGH | Changelog | All version dates fabricated — v1.6.0 "Jan 26", v1.0.0 "Nov 30" — product didn't exist then |
| H-22 | HIGH | Affiliate | Full affiliate page (30% commission, $50 payout) — no backend built |
| H-23 | HIGH | Shipping Labels | "Create Label" + "Compare Rates" buttons enabled — EasyPost not built |
| H-24 | HIGH | Connections | Only 6/9 platforms shown — missing Etsy, Shopify, Whatnot |
| H-25 | HIGH | Forgot Password | "Send Reset Link" requires SMTP — will fail |
| M-25 | MEDIUM | Calendar dark mode | "Month" button invisible — white text on white background |
| M-26 | MEDIUM | Knowledge Base | "No FAQs" + "No articles" — need basic content before launch |
| M-27 | MEDIUM | Report Builder | "Custom Query — Run SQL queries" — security concern if raw SQL exposed |
| M-28 | MEDIUM | Teams | "Create Team" — is this Free plan? Needs tier gating |
| M-29 | MEDIUM | Roadmap | Empty — needs at least planned features pre-populated |
| M-30 | MEDIUM | Sales | "Sales Tax Nexus" — US concept, Canada uses GST/HST/PST |
| M-31 | MEDIUM | Transactions | "All Categorie" — truncated dropdown text (missing 's') |
| M-32 | MEDIUM | Transactions | "$0 / $999" filter — USD not CAD |
| M-33 | MEDIUM | Privacy Policy | Contact email "privacy@vaultlister.com" — is it set up? |
| L-20 | LOW | Size Charts | "us US" dropdown label — double "US" |
| L-21 | LOW | Size Charts | Measurements in inches — should offer cm for Canada |
| L-22 | LOW | Privacy/ToS | "Last updated: March 2026" — should be April |
| L-23 | LOW | Checklist | "Keep up the momentum!" at 0% — odd encouragement for nothing done |
| L-24 | LOW | Refer a Friend | "VAULTDEMO" referral code — hardcoded, not user-specific |
| CO-6 | COSMETIC | Refer a Friend | Logo shows "V" overlaid on purple — inconsistent with other pages |

### Dark Mode Testing (10 pages tested)
Dashboard, Inventory, Settings, Financials, Offers, Listings, Calendar, About, Shops (prior session), Analytics (prior session)

| Page | Result |
|------|--------|
| Dashboard | Pass |
| Inventory | Pass |
| Settings | Pass |
| Financials | Pass |
| Offers | Pass |
| Listings | Pass |
| Calendar | **FAIL** — "Month" button invisible (M-25) |
| About | Pass |

### Interaction Testing
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| "+ Add Item" button click | No response on click (test env limitation — modal works via JS call) |
| Add Item modal (via JS) | Opens correctly — full form with 20+ fields |
| Global search bar | No autocomplete/dropdown shown when typing (fetch mock may intercept) |
| Sidebar navigation | All items render correct pages |

### Button Click Summary
Due to fake session + fetch mock, most button clicks that trigger API calls show no visible response. This makes interactive testing unreliable in this environment. **Real interaction testing requires a live authenticated session with actual database.**

| CRITICAL | 16 |
| HIGH | 25 |
| MEDIUM | 33 |
| LOW | 24 |
| COSMETIC | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **104** |

### Coverage Achieved
| Category | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Pages screenshotted | **70/70 (100%)** |
| Dark mode tested | 10/70 (14%) — major pages covered |
| Button interactions | Limited (fake session blocks API calls) |
| Modal testing | 1 modal tested (Add Item) |
| Form submissions | 0 (requires real auth) |
| Responsive/mobile | 0 (requires viewport resize) |
| Source code audit | 2 agents completed (legacy + actual source modules) |

### Additional Findings from Extended Interaction Testing

| # | Sev | Area | Issue |
|---|-----|------|-------|
| CR-17 | CRITICAL | Planner | `pages.planner()` function doesn't exist — sidebar nav item is dead. Route registered but no page function defined in any source module |
| H-26 | HIGH | Listings | Platform dropdown only shows 6 of 9 platforms — missing Etsy, Shopify, Whatnot |
| H-27 | HIGH | Listings | "Add New Listing(s)" primary CTA dropdown button has NO onclick handler |
| M-34 | MEDIUM | Vault Buddy | Chat bubble click does nothing — no chat window opens |
| M-35 | MEDIUM | Batch Photo | "Remove Background" and "AI Upscale" require AI backend — will they error gracefully? |
| M-36 | MEDIUM | Privacy (in-app) | "GDPR Compliant" claim — Canada uses PIPEDA, not GDPR. Legal risk |
| L-25 | LOW | Listings | "Customize" columns button has no onclick handler |
| L-26 | LOW | Listings | Announcement banner "✕" close button has no onclick handler |
| L-27 | LOW | Connections (dark) | Cloudinary/Anthropic AI toggle buttons nearly invisible in dark mode |
| L-28 | LOW | Privacy (in-app) | "Download PDF" button — does it generate a real PDF? |

### Pass 4 — Dark Mode Batch + Responsive + Extended Interaction

| # | Sev | Area | Issue |
|---|-----|------|-------|
| H-28 | HIGH | Responsive | Sidebar doesn't collapse on mobile viewport — no hamburger menu visible. Known bug #31 |
| M-37 | MEDIUM | Calendar (dark) | "Month" view button invisible — white text on white bg in active state |
| M-38 | MEDIUM | Responsive | 34 mobile breakpoints exist in CSS but mobile bottom nav absent |
| M-39 | MEDIUM | Privacy (in-app) | Claims "GDPR Compliant" — Canada uses PIPEDA. Legal risk |
| L-29 | LOW | Connections (dark) | Cloudinary/Anthropic toggles nearly invisible |
| L-30 | LOW | Batch Photo | "Remove Background"/"AI Upscale" may not have backend |
| L-31 | LOW | Privacy (in-app) | "Download PDF" button — untested |

Dark mode DOM scan (47 pages): **All pass** — no hardcoded white backgrounds or dark text found. CSS custom properties handle theming correctly.

Dark mode visual verification (15 pages total): Dashboard, Inventory, Settings, Financials, Offers, Listings, Calendar(FAIL), About, Shops, Analytics, Affiliate, Connections, Community, Predictions — **1 failure** (Calendar Month button).

### FINAL TOTAL: 121 findings

| CRITICAL | 17 |
| HIGH | 28 |
| MEDIUM | 39 |

- SMTP/email flows (Reset Password, Email Verification)
- Image upload to R2
- Shipping label creation
- AI generation (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Community post creation
- Form data persistence

## NEW FINDINGS — Modal Testing Session (2026-04-05 Post-Compact)

### Modal Test Results Summary (31 of 41 modals tested)

**FINDING #122 — MEDIUM: modals.editTemplate() silent failure**
- editTemplate() returns without error but no modal opens when called outside the Templates page context
- Likely requires the templates page DOM structure to be present
- Impact: Edit template functionality may be broken for users unless triggered from the correct page

**FINDING #123 — HIGH: modals.viewPost() crashes with runtime error**
- modals.viewPost() throws: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'find')`
- Crashes even with communityPosts correctly set in store
- Tries to call .find() on an undefined array (likely a secondary data array)
- Impact: Community post viewing is broken — users cannot view any posts

**FINDING #124 — MEDIUM: modals.viewArticle() fails to open modal**
- modals.viewArticle() with correct helpArticles in store returns 'opened' but no modal appears
- Modal opens but immediately closes, or renders in wrong DOM target
- Impact: Help article viewing broken

**FINDING #125 — HIGH: modals.viewTicket() crashes with runtime error**
- modals.viewTicket() throws: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`
- Crashes with both string ID and full ticket object arguments
- Impact: Support ticket viewing broken — users cannot view ticket details

**FINDING #126 — HIGH: Cross-list modal shows Etsy/Mercari/Grailed as active (Canada launch scope)**
- crosslistItems modal shows: Poshmark, eBay, Etsy, Mercari, Depop, Grailed, Facebook, Whatnot, Shopify(COMING SOON)
- For Canada launch: only eBay, Poshmark, Facebook, Depop, Whatnot should be active
- Etsy, Mercari, and Grailed should show "COMING SOON" badge (same as Shopify currently)
- Impact: Users can attempt to cross-list to platforms not yet configured for Canada launch

**FINDING #127 — LOW: "Ebay" brand name misspelled in cross-list modal**
- Cross-list modal shows "Ebay" instead of correct "eBay" brand capitalization
- Appears in crosslistItems modal platform list

**FINDING #128 — LOW: editCalendarEvent has "Depends On" field not present in addCalendarEvent**
- Edit Event modal has "Depends On (optional)" dropdown field
- Add Event modal does not have this field
- Inconsistency: users can only set dependencies when editing, not when creating

---

**FINDING #129 — MEDIUM: modals.viewWhatnotEvent() — 3 data display bugs**
- Start Time shows "Invalid Date" — ISO timestamp not parsed correctly by the date formatter
- Status badge shows "undefined" — `status` field not being read from the event object
- Event title/name not displayed in the modal header at all
- Impact: Whatnot event view modal is mostly unreadable; users see blank/broken data

**FINDING #130 — LOW: modals.viewReport() — shows raw ID instead of report content**
- viewReport('rpt-test-1') renders the string "rpt-test-1" as the report body
- Function passes the raw argument to content renderer without doing a store lookup
- Report name "Monthly Summary" also not shown as the modal title (shows generic "Report")
- Impact: Report viewer modal shows no useful data

**FINDING #131 — HIGH: modals.confirm() — danger button invisible in light mode**
- `btn-danger` has transparent background in light mode (CSS variable `--red-600`/`--error` not resolving)
- White text on transparent background = completely invisible on white modal
- Confirm button is present in DOM but invisible to users
- Affects all confirm dialogs with `danger: true` (delete confirmations, destructive actions)
- Impact: Users cannot confirm any destructive action — delete flows are broken

---

## MODALS TESTING COMPLETE — All 41 modals tested

### Results Summary:
- ✅ PASS (no issues): 30 modals
- ⚠️ PASS with minor bugs: 5 modals (viewWhatnotEvent, viewReport, showItemHistory price display, editTemplate page-context, batchPhoto)
- ❌ CRASH / non-functional: 4 modals (viewPost, viewTicket crash; viewArticle, editTemplate silent fail)
- 🔴 HIGH bugs in otherwise-opening modals: 1 (confirm — danger button invisible)

**FINDING #132 — LOW: Changelog version thumbnail cards have light background in dark mode**
- Version timeline sidebar cards (v1.6.0, v1.5.0, etc.) retain a light gray/white background in dark mode
- Other page elements correctly darken, but these version cards do not inherit dark theme
- Impact: Visual inconsistency — white card patches in otherwise dark sidebar
- Note: Content is readable, no data is hidden

**FINDING #131 CLARIFICATION: confirm() danger button — light mode only**
- btn-danger transparent background issue ONLY affects light mode
- In dark mode (body.dark-mode .btn-danger), the red background renders correctly (confirmed on whatnotLive page Delete button)
- Finding #131 severity remains HIGH — light mode is the primary/default mode for new users

### Session 5 — 6 Previously Missed Pages (all completed)

These 6 were omitted from the original "Still Remaining" list despite being valid page functions:

| Page | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| automations | ✅ PASS | Scheduler Health, System Active card, Performance Metrics all dark |
| helpSupport | ✅ PASS | Same render as `help` — CR-7/CR-8 pre-existing, no dark mode issues |
| resetPassword | ✅ PASS | "Set New Password" card form, clean dark styling |
| terms | ✅ PASS | Same render as `termsOfService` — ToC sidebar + accordion sections dark |
| emailVerification | ✅ PASS | "Check Your Email" card — gray icon placeholder (likely missing asset, not DM issue) |
| verifyEmail | ✅ PASS | "Verification Failed" state — expected without real token, dark mode clean |

---

## SESSION 4 FINDINGS — Dark Mode Batch (35 pages)

**FINDING #133 — MEDIUM: Support Tickets (reportBug) — "undefined" in ticket card metadata**
- Ticket card displays "undefined" text in a metadata field (likely priority or assignee)
- A null-guard is missing in the ticket card rendering function
- Impact: Any support ticket shown to users will display "undefined" — looks broken and unprofessional
- Affected: reportBug page ticket list cards

**FINDING #134 — LOW: Feedback Analytics — admin badge does not inherit dark mode**
- A white/light pill badge near the feedbackAnalytics page title does not darken in dark mode
- All surrounding elements correctly switch to dark theme
- Impact: Visual inconsistency — white patch against dark background

**FINDING #135 — LOW: Help page — Quick Start Guide step 4 text truncates**
- Step 4 of the Quick Start Guide panel clips mid-word: "Set up automati... to save t..."
- Other steps render their full description text without truncation
- Impact: Incomplete instruction visible to new users going through onboarding

**FINDING #136 — HIGH: Privacy Policy page — factually false data storage claims**
- In-app Privacy Policy page contains: "Your inventory, listings, and sales data never leave your device unless you explicitly share them" and "Data is not uploaded to any cloud servers without your consent"
- VaultLister is a Railway-hosted cloud SaaS — ALL data is uploaded to cloud servers by design
- Impact: Legal/trust risk — users may argue they were misled about where their data is stored
- This is distinct from the public privacy.html (which may be accurate) — this is the in-app policy text

**FINDING #137 — LOW: Privacy Policy page — stale "Last updated" date**
- In-app privacyPolicy page shows "Last updated: January 2026"
- The static privacy page (privacy.html) shows "Last updated: April 5, 2026"
- Impact: Inconsistency — the in-app policy appears months out of date

**FINDING #138 — LOW: Account page — text truncates in narrow card columns**
- Account details card columns are too narrow, causing visible truncation:
  - "Member Since: Marc..." (should be "March 2026" or full date)
  - "Curre plan" (should be "Current plan")
- Impact: Broken-looking account details for all users

**FINDING #139 — LOW: Submit Feedback — inactive feedback type buttons white in dark mode**
- "Improvement", "Bug Report", and "General" type selector buttons retain white/light backgrounds in dark mode
- Only the active "Feature Request" button shows correct blue styling
- Impact: Three white button patches in an otherwise dark form — visual inconsistency

---

## FORM + INTERACTION TESTING (2026-04-05 — Session 6)

**Method:** JavaScript-driven form submission tests on 8 forms/modals

**FINDING #141 — HIGH: Add Item — success triggers "undefined" content in main area**
- After submitting Add Item modal with valid Title + List Price, toast shows "Item added successfully!" but the main content area renders the literal text "undefined"
- Router navigates post-submit but the target page function returns undefined
- Impact: Crashes the page after every successful item add — users see broken UI immediately after adding inventory

**FINDING #142 — MEDIUM: Add Transaction — empty submit shows no validation error**
- Add Transaction modal has `required` attributes on Amount field but no `<form>` element
- Clicking Submit with empty Amount: modal closes silently, no validation tooltip shown
- Pattern: state-controlled form bypasses native HTML5 validation
- Impact: Silent data loss — incomplete transactions may be saved or silently dropped

**FINDING #143 — HIGH: Add Transaction — modal HTML bleeds into page body**
- While Add Transaction modal is open, raw HTML attribute text renders visibly in the page body below the modal: `" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" role="document"> Add Transaction`
- Impact: Visible code artifacts in the UI — looks broken to users

**FINDING #143b — MEDIUM: Add Transaction — no success feedback on submit**
- Submitting a valid Add Transaction form closes the modal silently — no toast, no confirmation, no page update
- All other create/save flows show a success toast
- Impact: Users don't know if their transaction was saved

**FINDING #144 — HIGH: Submit Feedback — simultaneously fires success and error toasts**
- Submitting the Feedback form with valid content (type + message) fires BOTH:
  - Green toast: "Feedback submitted successfully!"
  - Red toast: "Failed to submit feedback. Please try again."
- Both appear at the same time on the same valid submission
- Impact: Confusing UX — users see conflicting messages and don't know if submission worked

**FINDING #145 — MEDIUM: Community Create Post — empty submit shows no validation**
- Create Post modal has required Title and Content fields with `required` attributes but no `<form>` wrapper
- Clicking Post with empty fields: no validation tooltip, no error message shown
- Impact: Empty posts may be submitted silently

**FINDING #146 — MEDIUM: Calendar Add Event — empty submit shows no validation**
- Add Event modal has a required Event Title field but no `<form>` wrapper
- Clicking Create Event with empty title: no validation feedback shown
- Impact: Events with blank titles may be created silently

**FINDING #147 — MEDIUM: Global search bar — non-functional**
- Typing into the top nav "Search inventory, listings..." input shows text in field but produces no results, no dropdown overlay, no response
- Pressing Enter also has no effect
- Impact: Primary cross-section search feature is completely non-functional — users expect a search bar to work

**FINDING #148 — HIGH: Inventory "Search items..." — fires error toast on any input**
- Typing into the Inventory page search bar triggers an API call that returns "Search failed. Please try again." error toast
- Occurs even with a valid 200 API response (`{data:[], total:0, items:[]}`)
- Impact: Inventory search is broken — every keypress shows an error to users

**FINDING #149 — MEDIUM: Shipping Calculator — US carriers with imperial units**
- Shipping Cost Calculator shows USPS (First Class, Ground Advantage, Priority Mail) and Pirate Ship as carriers
- Units displayed as lbs and inches
- App targets Canadian sellers — should show Canada Post, Chitchats, Purolator with kg/cm and CAD pricing
- Impact: Calculator is not useful for the target market — Canadian sellers will see irrelevant US-only options

**FINDING #150 — CRITICAL: Import CSV — Parse Data crashes with JavaScript exception**
- Pasting valid CSV (`title,price,quantity\nNike Shoes,45.00,1`) and clicking Parse Data fires error toast: "Failed to parse data: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')"
- Handler calls `.get()` on an uninitialized state Map
- Import page is completely non-functional
- Impact: Users cannot import inventory via CSV/TSV/JSON — core onboarding feature broken

**FINDING #151 — CRITICAL: Create SKU Rule — crashes with JavaScript exception**
- Filling in Rule Name + Pattern and clicking Create Rule fires: "Failed to create SKU rule: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')"
- Same root cause as Finding #150 — handler calls `.get()` on an uninitialized state Map
- SKU rule management is completely non-functional
- Impact: No SKU rules can be created — inventory SKU auto-generation is broken

---

## CTA BUTTON TESTING (2026-04-05 — Session 7)

**FINDING #152 — HIGH: Log Sale — crashes with JavaScript exception**
- Clicking "Log Sale" on the Dashboard fires error toast: "Failed to log sale: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')"
- Same root cause as Findings #150/#151 — handler calls `.get()` on an uninitialized state Map
- Impact: Users cannot manually log a sale from the Dashboard — core workflow broken

**FINDING #153 — HIGH: Orders Sync — crashes with JavaScript exception**
- Clicking "Sync" on the Orders page fires two simultaneous toasts: "Syncing orders from all connected platforms..." then immediately "Failed to sync orders: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')"
- Same root cause as #150/#151/#152 — uninitialized state Map
- Impact: Order sync completely non-functional — users cannot pull orders from connected platforms

**FINDING #154 — HIGH: Automations Export — fires multiple "Export failed" toasts**
- Clicking the "Export" button on the Automations page fires 4+ simultaneous "Export failed" error toasts
- No CSV/JSON is produced
- Impact: Cannot export automation rules — users cannot back up or share their automations

**FINDING #155 — MEDIUM: Platform Fee Calculator — wrong platforms for Canada launch**
- The Listings → Fees calculator shows: eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, Facebook, Etsy
- Canada launch platforms are: eBay, Poshmark, Facebook, Depop, Whatnot
- Mercari and Etsy are NOT Canada launch platforms; Whatnot IS but is MISSING from the calculator
- Impact: Fee calculator is inaccurate for the target market — missing the Whatnot live selling platform

---

## PASSES — CTA Button Testing (Session 7)
- Dashboard: Refresh ✅, Daily Summary ✅, Profit Goals ✅, Quick Notes ✅, Customize Dashboard ✅, Export ✅, Add Item (known #141)
- Inventory: Bundle ✅, Restock ✅, Alerts ✅, Lookup ✅, Tools→Bulk Prices ✅, Tools→Age Analysis ✅, Tools→Calculator ✅, Import ✅, Export ✅, Bulk Edit ✅

| HIGH | 39 |
| MEDIUM | 50 |
| LOW | 40 |
| COSMETIC | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **154** |

---

## SESSION 8 — CTA Button Testing (Settings + Plans)

### PASSES — Session 8
- Settings: Reset to Defaults ✅ (shows confirmation dialog before resetting)
- Settings: Enable 2FA ✅ (shows method selector: Authenticator App / SMS Code)
- Plans: Upgrade to Premium ✅ (calls showPlanComparison, navigates to plans-billing page)

---

**FINDING #156 — LOW: Analytics — Weekly Report shows same start/end date**
- Analytics → More → "Weekly Performance" modal header shows: "Week of Apr 5 - Apr 5, 2026"
- Start date and end date are identical; should span 7 days (e.g., "Apr 5 - Apr 12, 2026")
- Impact: Week duration displays incorrectly — minor UX confusion

---

**FINDING #157 — COSMETIC: My Shops — "Ebay" capitalization incorrect**
- My Shops page shows "Connect to Ebay" — should be "eBay" (official brand name)
- All other references in the app use "eBay" correctly
- Impact: Brand name inconsistency on a key page

---

**FINDING #158 — HIGH: Reports — Create Report buttons silently do nothing**
- Reports page: both the empty-state "Create Report" CTA and the "+ New Report" toolbar button call `handlers.createReport()`
- Handler returns a Promise but produces no visible result: no modal, no toast, no navigation
- Verified: direct call `handlers.createReport()` returns `[object Promise]` with zero toast output
- Impact: Custom report creation is completely non-functional — no user feedback whatsoever

---

**FINDING #159 — MEDIUM: Vault Buddy auto-opens on every page render**
- `renderApp()` triggers Vault Buddy panel to open automatically on every page load
- Each auto-open fires a "Failed to load conversations" error toast (due to fake/missing API token)
- In production with real auth, users will see Vault Buddy opening unexpectedly on every navigation
- Impact: Disruptive UX — chat panel intrudes on page content; should default to closed and only open on explicit user action

---

**FINDING #160 — CRITICAL: Plans & Billing — "Upgrade to Pro" crashes**
- Plans & Billing page: "Upgrade to Pro" button calls `handlers.selectPlan('pro')`
- Crashes immediately: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')"
- Same crash pattern as #150 (Import CSV) and #151 (Create SKU Rule)
- Impact: Users cannot upgrade to Pro plan — core monetization flow is broken

---

**FINDING #161 — CRITICAL: Plans & Billing — "Upgrade to Business" crashes**
- Plans & Billing page: "Upgrade to Business" button calls `handlers.selectPlan('business')`
- Crashes with same error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')"
- Impact: Users cannot upgrade to Business plan — core monetization flow is broken

**Changes from Session 6 total (150):** +3 HIGH (#152, #153, #154), +1 MEDIUM (#155)

---

## Session 10 — CTA Button Testing

**FINDING #162 — LOW: Orders page "More" dropdown does nothing**
- Orders page header: "More" button has no onclick handler in DOM
- The sibling `.dropdown-menu` has `visibility: hidden` and no toggle mechanism
- Click produces zero response — no dropdown, no toast, no error
- Confirmed via DOM inspection: `button.getAttribute('onclick')` → null
- Impact: Any actions in the "More" menu are inaccessible

---

**FINDING #163 — COSMETIC: Listing Health modal contradictory empty-state text**
- Listings → Health button → "Listing Health Score" modal
- Header shows score 0 with label "Poor Health" and "0 listings analyzed"
- Body simultaneously shows "All listings have good health scores!"
- Contradictory: "Poor Health" score vs "all good" message
- Impact: Confusing UX for new users with 0 listings

---

**FINDING #164 — MEDIUM: Platform Fee Calculator uses "$" not "C$", includes Etsy**
- Listings → Fees button → "Platform Fee Calculator"
- All amounts shown in "$" (USD) — should be "C$" for Canadian launch
- Modal includes Etsy fees, but Etsy is a deferred/unsupported platform for Canadian launch
- Fee structures shown (e.g. Poshmark "Flat 20% or $2.95 under $15") are US-based, may differ from Canadian pricing
- Impact: Canadian sellers see incorrect currency symbol and non-applicable platform fees

---

**FINDING #165 — MEDIUM: Automations "Calendar" button — no response**
- Automations toolbar → Calendar button → calls `handlers.showScheduleCalendar()`
- No modal opens, no toast notification, no navigation, no visible UI change
- Function exists but produces no output — dead button
- Impact: Users cannot view automation schedule calendar

---

**FINDING #166 — MEDIUM: Automations "Performance" button — no response**
- Automations toolbar → Performance button → calls `handlers.showAutomationPerformance()`
- No modal opens, no toast notification, no navigation, no visible UI change
- Function exists but produces no output — dead button
- Impact: Users cannot view automation performance metrics

---

**FINDING #167 — MEDIUM: Financials page uses "$" not "C$"**
- Financials page → Revenue, Expenses, Net Profit, Cash Flow, Budget Settings sections
- All monetary values displayed as "$0.00" (USD symbol)
- Should display "C$0.00" for Canadian launch (same as other pages)
- Impact: Inconsistent currency presentation on financial data page

---

| **TOTAL** | **166** |

**Changes from Session 10 total (163):** +3 MEDIUM (#165, #166, #167)

---

**FINDING #168 — COSMETIC: eBay Connect modal title shows "Ebay" not "eBay"**
- My Shops → eBay Connect button → modal title reads "Connect to Ebay"
- Should read "Connect to eBay" (correct brand capitalization)
- Impact: Minor brand inconsistency

---

**FINDING #169 — MEDIUM: My Shops shows 4 non-Canadian-launch platforms without "Coming Soon" indicator**
- My Shops page shows all 9 platforms: Poshmark, eBay, Mercari, Depop, Grailed, Etsy, Shopify, Facebook, Whatnot
- Canadian launch supports only 5: eBay, Poshmark, Facebook, Depop, Whatnot
- Mercari, Grailed, Etsy, Shopify are shown with active "Connect" buttons — no "Coming Soon" or "Not available in Canada" label
- Users can attempt to connect unsupported platforms (OAuth will fail in production)
- Impact: Confusing UX; users may waste time trying to connect unsupported platforms

---

**FINDING #170 — HIGH: All Connect modals pre-fill username with hardcoded "demo@vaultlister.com"**
- My Shops → Connect button (any platform) → username field contains "demo@vaultlister.com" as a pre-filled value (not placeholder text)
- Confirmed via DOM: `input.value = "demo@vaultlister.com"`, `input.placeholder = "Your poshmark username"`
- User must manually clear the field before entering their own username — easy to miss
- Impact: New users who don't notice will attempt to connect with the wrong username — onboarding blocker

**Changes from previous total (166):** +1 HIGH (#170), +1 MEDIUM (#169), +1 COSMETIC (#168)

---

**FINDING #171 — CRITICAL: Calendar page fails to render — "date is not defined"**
- Navigating to Calendar page → `pages.calendar()` throws `ReferenceError: date is not defined` at `pages-deferred.js:7537`
- Source file (`pages-tools-tasks.js:444`) uses `currentDate` — deployed bundle uses stale variable name `date`
- Calendar page is completely inaccessible via normal navigation
- Impact: Entire Calendar feature unavailable to all users

---

**FINDING #172 — HIGH: Calendar "Today" and "Week" buttons crash with same error**
- Calendar toolbar → "Today" button → `handlers.calendarGoToday()` → `ReferenceError: date is not defined`
- Calendar toolbar → "Week" button → `handlers.setCalendarView('week')` → same error
- Root cause: same stale bundle variable as #171
- Calendar "Day" view works; Add Event ✅ and Schedule Live Show ✅ modals both open correctly
- Impact: Two of five toolbar buttons completely broken

---

**FINDING #173 — MEDIUM: Reports "Create Report" button — no response**
- Reports page → Create Report button → `handlers.createReport()` fires but no modal opens, no navigation, no toast
- Dead button — no visual feedback whatsoever
- Impact: Users cannot create new reports

---

**FINDING #174 — MEDIUM: Settings "Enable 2FA" button — no response**
- Settings → Account tab → Enable 2FA button → `handlers.enable2FA()` fires but no modal opens, no UI change
- Dead button
- Impact: Users cannot enable 2FA/MFA from Settings

---

**FINDING #175 — MEDIUM: Plans & Billing page shows USD pricing ($19, $49)**
- Plans & Billing → Pro card "$19/month", Business card "$49/month"
- Should display CAD pricing (C$) for Canadian launch
- Also: Pro plan description says "Cross-list to all 9 platforms" — Canadian launch supports only 5
- Impact: Canadian users see incorrect currency and inaccurate feature claims

---

**FINDING #176 — LOW: Plans page naming inconsistency — "Upgrade to Premium" vs "Pro"**
- Current Plan section shows "Upgrade to Premium" button
- Plan cards and rest of UI use "Pro" (not "Premium")
- Impact: Confusing terminology — users may not know "Premium" = "Pro"

---

**FINDING #177 — MEDIUM: "Upgrade to Pro" / "Upgrade to Business" buttons produce no UI response**
- Plans page → Upgrade to Pro / Upgrade to Business buttons → `handlers.selectPlan('pro')` and `handlers.selectPlan('business')` fire but produce no toast, no modal, no loading state, no Stripe redirect
- Users receive zero feedback — cannot tell if click was registered
- Impact: Upgrade flow completely broken (silent failure instead of Stripe redirect)

## Session 12 — CTA Button Testing Complete (Inventory, Listings, Orders, Offers, Settings)

**No new findings.** All remaining CTA buttons tested — all pass.

### Results by Page

**Dashboard (resolved):** Add Item button in FAB correctly calls `router.navigate('inventory')` + `modals.addItem()` — not a dead button. Log Sale → `router.navigate('sales')` — correct navigation.

**Inventory (9/9 ✅):** Bundle Builder, Restock Suggestions, Low Stock Alerts, Quick Item Lookup — all open correct modals. Tools dropdown (Bulk Price Update, Inventory Age Analysis, Profit Margin Calculator) — all open correct modals. Add Item → "Add New Item" modal ✅. Import → "Import Inventory" modal ✅. Export CSV → fires without error ✅. Bulk Edit → shows warning toast when no items selected; opens "Bulk Edit (N items)" modal with items selected ✅.

**Listings (4/4 ✅):** Health → "Listing Health Score" modal ✅. New Folder → "Create Folder" modal ✅. Fees → "Platform Fee Calculator" modal ✅. Add New Listing(s) → Create New → "Create New Listing" modal ✅.

**Orders (5/5 ✅):** Ship Calc → "Shipping Cost Calculator" modal ✅. Returns → "Return Analytics" modal ✅. Sync → fires async API call ✅. More → Import Orders → "Import Orders" modal ✅. More → Generate Labels → "Generate Shipping Labels" modal ✅. Shipping Labels → `router.navigate('shipping-labels')` (navigation, expected).

**Offers (1/1 ✅):** Item History → "Item History" modal opens correctly when item exists in store ✅.

**Settings (2/2 ✅):** Reset to Defaults → "Reset [Section]" confirm modal opens ✅. Edit in Settings → `router.navigate('settings')` (navigation, expected). Enable 2FA → already documented as #174.

### Coverage After Session 12

- CTA button testing: **~95% complete** (all major CTAs tested; Shipping Labels navigation not testable without bridge disconnect)
- Section 5 in WALKTHROUGH_REMAINING.md: **COMPLETE ✅**

---

## Session 13 — Public HTML Pages + Navigation Testing

### §14 Public HTML Pages

**#178 — MEDIUM: `offline.html` server-redirects to `/` (landing page)**
- **Page:** `https://vaultlister.com/offline.html`
- **Expected:** Renders offline fallback page (dark gradient, "You're offline" message)
- **Actual:** Server redirects to `/` (landing page) — the HTML file exists in `public/offline.html` with correct offline content, but the server routes it away
- **Impact:** Service Worker offline fallback is broken — users who lose connectivity will see the landing page instead of an offline message
- **Severity:** MEDIUM

**Pages PASS:** `rate-limits.html` ✅, `api-docs.html` ✅ (full Swagger UI), `api-changelog.html` ✅, `er-diagram.html` ✅, `schema.html` ✅
**Note on `schema.html`:** Shows default timezone `'America/New_York'` and locale `'en-US'` — both US defaults for a Canadian-market app (low priority doc fix).

---

### §8 Navigation Testing

**Sidebar navigation (22/22 items) — ALL PASS ✅**
All sidebar items navigate to correct routes:
Dashboard→#dashboard, Inventory→#inventory, Listings→#listings, Orders & Sales→#orders-sales, Offers→#offers, Automations→#automations, Financials→#financials, Analytics→#analytics, My Shops→#shops, Planner→#planner, Image Bank→#image-bank, Calendar→#calendar, Reports→#reports, Import→#inventory-import, Receipts→#receipt-parser, Community→#community, Roadmap→#roadmap, Plans & Billing→#plans-billing, Account→#account, Settings→#settings, Help→#help-support, Changelog→#changelog

**Breadcrumb:** Home link → #dashboard ✅
**Browser back:** `history.back()` — navigated from #dashboard → #inventory ✅
**Browser forward:** `history.forward()` — navigated back to #dashboard ✅
**Sidebar collapse toggle:** `.sidebar-collapse-btn` → adds `sidebar-collapsed` class ✅ (visual collapse works)

**#179 — LOW: Sidebar collapse state not persisted**
- Clicking collapse button adds `sidebar-collapsed` CSS class
- BUT: `localStorage.getItem('vaultlister_sidebar_collapsed')` returns `null`
- No sidebar-related keys exist in localStorage at all
- Collapsing the sidebar does not survive page reload
- **Severity:** LOW

**#180 — MEDIUM: Unknown routes while authenticated silently fall back to dashboard**
- `router.handleRoute('nonexistent-page-xyz')` → shows dashboard, not 404 page
- `router.handleRoute('404')` → also shows dashboard (the 404 route IS registered but the handler seems blocked when authenticated)
- **Expected:** Unknown hash → show 404 page
- **Impact:** Users entering bad bookmarks or mistyped URLs see blank dashboard with no feedback that the route doesn't exist
- **Severity:** MEDIUM

**#181 — COSMETIC: "Planner" sidebar label doesn't match page title "Daily Checklist"**
- Sidebar label: "Planner", URL hash: #planner, breadcrumb: "Manage > Planner"
- Page H2 title: "Daily Checklist"
- Inconsistent naming across sidebar vs page heading
- **Severity:** COSMETIC

---

### §12 Scroll Testing

Scroll heights measured across 5 pages (viewport height: 941px):

| Page | scrollHeight | Ratio | Assessment |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Planner (Daily Checklist) | 1,192px | 1.27x | ✅ Normal |
| Settings | 1,538px | 1.63x | ✅ Normal |
| Analytics | 2,690px | 2.86x | ✅ Multiple sections |
| Financials | 4,046px | 4.30x | ✅ Reasonable for data-heavy page |
| Dashboard | 5,076px | 5.39x | ⚠️ Elevated — Customize Dashboard panel open (pre-existing) |

No new scroll issues found beyond the pre-existing dashboard whitespace (documented in earlier sessions). All pages are scrollable and content terminates properly.

### §10 Drag-and-Drop (Session 14)

**#182 — HIGH: DOMPurify sanitizeHTML() strips all drag-and-drop event handlers**
- `sanitizeHTML()` in `src/frontend/core/utils.js:59-61` uses DOMPurify with ADD_ATTR allowlist that includes onclick/onchange/etc but omits ALL drag handlers
- Missing from ADD_ATTR: `ondragover`, `ondragleave`, `ondrop`, `ondragenter`, `ondragstart`, `ondragend`
- DOM inspection confirmed: Add Item modal `#dropzone-add`, Inventory Import `#import-drop-zone`, Image Bank `#quick-upload-zone` all have drag handlers stripped from their rendered elements
- Source code has inline drag handlers (e.g. `ondragover="event.preventDefault(); this.classList.add('dragover')"`) but DOM shows them absent
- **Impact:** File drag-and-drop is silently broken on 3 upload surfaces — files can only be selected via click, not dragged
- **Fix:** Add `'ondragover', 'ondragleave', 'ondrop', 'ondragenter', 'ondragstart', 'ondragend'` to ADD_ATTR array in `utils.js`
- **Severity:** HIGH

**§10 PASS items:**
- Dashboard widget reorder: `widgetManager.reorderWidgets()` updates store correctly; `renderApp(pages.dashboard())` re-renders in saved order (`domMatchesStore: true`) ✅
- HTML5 DnD `addEventListener` approach in widgets.js is NOT affected by DOMPurify (uses addEventListener, not inline handlers) ✅

### §11 Error State Testing (Session 14)

Error states tested by intercepting API calls and forcing failure responses.

**#183 — MEDIUM: 401 Unauthorized response does not redirect to login**
- When API returns 401 (token expired / unauthorized), app does not redirect to login or show a session-expired message
- User remains on current page with silent API failures
- **Expected:** On 401, clear session, show "Session expired — please log in again" toast, redirect to #login
- **Severity:** MEDIUM

**#184 — LOW: 429 Too Many Requests shows generic error toast with no retry guidance**
- When API returns 429, app shows generic "Request failed" error toast
- No specific message about rate limiting or when to retry
- **Expected:** "Too many requests — please wait a moment and try again"
- **Severity:** LOW

**§11 Notes:**
- Network failure (fetch rejection): generic "Failed to fetch" / "Network error" toast shown — acceptable basic handling ✅
- 500 server errors: generic error toast shown — acceptable ✅
- Full error state testing requires a real API session; fake session limits coverage

### §13 Vault Buddy Chat (Session 14)

**#185 — MEDIUM: toggleVaultBuddy crashes `pages[currentPage] is not a function`**
- Console error: `TypeError: pages[store.state.currentPage] is not a function` at `chunk-deferred.js:19829`
- `toggleVaultBuddy` tries to call `pages[store.state.currentPage]()` to re-render the page after opening the chat panel
- Crashes when `store.state.currentPage` is a deferred-chunk page that isn't loaded in `pages` at call time
- Chat panel still visually opens but background page re-render fails silently
- Likely root cause: same `window.pages` vs bare `pages` ESM shim variable collision (see architecture memory — bug #bun_chunk_shim)
- **Fix:** Use `window.pages[store.state.currentPage]()` in `toggleVaultBuddy`
- **Severity:** MEDIUM

**#186 — HIGH: Vault Buddy chat completely non-functional — all operations crash**
- Console: `Failed to load conversations: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')` — same `undefined.get` crash as bugs #150 and #151
- Starting a new chat (`handlers.startNewVaultBuddyChat()`) returns a Promise that resolves to nothing; UI never transitions to chat input
- Chat history cannot be loaded; new chats cannot be created
- **Impact:** Vault Buddy AI assistant is entirely non-functional on live site
- **Root cause:** Same `db.get()` crash as Import CSV (#150) and Create SKU Rule (#151) — database query object is undefined when deferred chunk code runs
- **Severity:** HIGH

**§13 PASS items:**
- Chat bubble (`.vault-buddy-fab`) renders on all pages ✅
- Clicking bubble opens `.vault-buddy-modal.open` panel correctly ✅
- Welcome screen renders with capability list (6 items) ✅
- Two tabs present: "Start New Chat" + "My Chats" ✅
- Tab switching works (`handlers.switchVaultBuddyTab()`) ✅
- "My Chats" tab shows "No conversations yet." empty state + "Start Your First Chat" CTA ✅

### §15 Responsive Testing (Session 14)

No new findings. CSS breakpoints previously verified (28 media query rules at 768px and 480px). Visual testing below 821px remains blocked by Chrome minimum window width constraint. Confirmed in session 14:
- Viewport reported at 2193×941 CSS px, DPR 0.8
- `.mobile-bottom-nav`, `.sidebar` overlay, `show-mobile`/`hide-mobile` utility classes all confirmed in source ✅
- No visual responsive test possible without device emulation or real mobile device
