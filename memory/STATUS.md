# VaultLister 3.0 — Session Status
**Updated:** 2026-05-03 MST (session 7)

## Current State
- **Live site:** https://vaultlister.com/?app=1
- **7 live platforms** — Grailed promoted from Coming Soon. Shopify OAuth fully configured (CLIENT_ID/SECRET/REDIRECT_URI in Railway).
- **Launch Readiness Walkthrough COMPLETE** — all 185 findings fixed + VERIFIED across 15 sessions. Remaining open items are external blockers only (CR-10, CR-4).
- **Deep-dive backlog FULLY AUDITED** — 9/10 P1+P2 items resolved or verified non-issues. R-003 (mixed service/router files) is cosmetic only.
- **Active task backlog:** `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md` — 2 launch blockers (CR-4, CR-10), 0 open GitHub issues.
- **BROWSER NOTE:** Always use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools. NEVER use `mcp__plugin_chrome-devtools-mcp`.
- **EASYPOST_API_KEY MISSING from Railway** — verified 2026-05-03 via Railway Variables tab (93 vars, no EASYPOST). Must be added manually. Routes return 503 without it.

## Last Completed Work (2026-05-03 session 7)

### CI workflow fix + EasyPost verification
- **project-status-update.yml fix** — `c578576f` pushed. Three changes: step `id: post-status`, `failure()` → `steps.post-status.outcome == 'failure'`, `state: 'open'` → `state: 'all'` with 24h `since` window. Prevents duplicate failure issues.
- **All CI green** — Production Smoke (success), Cloudflare Ops (success), Project Status Update (success), Uptime Slack Alert (success). Zero failed runs.
- **Zero open GitHub issues** — confirmed via `gh issue list`.
- **EasyPost routes verified live** — `/api/shipping-labels-mgmt/easypost/{rates,buy,track}` all return 401 (auth guard working). Route prefix is `/api/shipping-labels-mgmt` (NOT `/api/shipping-labels`).
- **EASYPOST_API_KEY NOT on Railway** — stale memory from 2026-04-20 claimed it was set. Verified via Railway Variables tab: 93 vars, no EASYPOST. Local .env has it commented out. Memory updated.
- **Stripe vars confirmed on Railway** — all 6 present: `STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS`, `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO`, `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER`, `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- **Auth tests: 26 pass/0 fail. Security tests: 32 pass/0 fail.**
- **14 TODO/FIXME items** — all reviewed: 5x signal-emitter (deferred), 2x CSP-hardening (deferred), rest are in scripts/QA/CI. Zero actionable bugs.

### Security audit + structural backlog verification
- **receiptParser.js filename XSS fix** — user-supplied `filename` now sanitized with regex (`[^a-zA-Z0-9._\-() ]` stripped) + 255-char limit before DB storage. Receipt tests: 52 pass/0 fail.
- **Ownership audit (IDOR)** — all 178 user-data mutations across inventory, listings, sales, offers, image vault include `WHERE user_id = ?`. No IDOR vulnerabilities.
- **Upload route security audit** — imageVault.js, batchPhoto.js, receiptParser.js all pass: MIME validation, 10MB size limits, path sanitization, ownership checks.
- **CORS audit** — `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` only for whitelisted origins, never wildcard. Secure.
- **Auth token lifecycle audit** — store.persist/hydrate cover both tokens, api.refreshAccessToken reads store.state, backend does refresh token rotation (old invalidated, new issued).
- **Stale Dockerfile.worker deleted** — root `Dockerfile.worker` was legacy (Playwright 1.58.2, no Camoufox). `worker/Dockerfile` is canonical (1.59.1, GTK deps, non-root user).
- **Playwright version drift resolved** — 1.59.1 across root package.json, worker/package.json, worker/Dockerfile.
- **Background worker audit** — taskWorker.js is producer-only (Queue), worker/index.js is consumer-only (Worker). No duplicate consumers.
- **deep-dive-backlog.md updated** — all 10 items verified with current status. R-018 env.md confirmed (168 lines).
- **OPEN_ITEMS.md regenerated** — passes `open-items:check`.

### CI/CD pipeline unblocked + full live verification
- **Production Smoke fix deployed** — commits `1249ee87`, `7031688a`, `dc4a78bc` pushed to origin/master. Redis unavailable/degraded no longer crashes smoke. Worker health timeout now non-blocking.
- **Railway deploying again** — Deploy workflow succeeded at `dc4a78bc`. Bundle version changed from `5035a71f` (stale since May 1 21:17 GMT) to `45dfb978`.
- **Health endpoint confirmed** — `status: ok`, database: ok, redis: ok.
- **Production Smoke CI** — 3 consecutive passes. Smoke failure GitHub issue auto-closed by recovery workflow.
- **All 16 DONE LOCAL items verified live** via chunk content analysis: Listing Defaults/Photo Settings removed, Image Vault rename complete (zero Image Bank hits), Facebook manual-connect only, 7 platforms in pricing/settings/landing, Gmail/Outlook Coming Soon, inventory-stock-out badge, checklist tab switching, IS_PROD guard on suppliers, webhooks aliased. See Next Tasks section for full verification matrix.

### Anti-detection, CR-10, GitHub triage
- **ANTI-09 multi-account isolation warning** — added to `src/frontend/pages/pages-settings-account.js` (correct chunk: `shops` → `settings` → `chunk-settings.js`). Warning renders when `connectedShops.length > 1`. Commit `85527bfe`.
- **ANTI-10 DataDome/Camoufox maintenance cadence** — documented in `docs/PERFECT_ANTI_DETECTION_SYSTEM.md`: retest monthly against antoinevastel.com/bots/datadome and bot.sannysoft.com from Railway.
- **ANTI-12 JA4 fingerprinting** — documented verification task: run `bun worker/bots/fingerprint-self-test.js` on Railway to capture TLS/JA4 output.
- **CR-10 OAuth connect checklist** — written at `docs/reference/cr10-oauth-connect-checklist.md`. All 8 platforms: eBay (OAuth), Shopify (OAuth), Depop (PKCE), Poshmark/Mercari/Grailed/Whatnot/Facebook (Playwright). Endpoints verified from source: connect = `POST /api/shops/`, callback = `GET /api/oauth/callback/<platform>?code=...&state=...`.
- **Mercari UI cleanup** — removed `mercari_relist` automation card from `pages-inventory-catalog.js`; removed Mercari from platform filter; updated community/about page partner list to reflect 7 live platforms.
- **GitHub issues triaged** — all 19 classified. Closed #488 (Lighthouse transient 48→72), #490; commented on #482, #491, #492. #489 auto-closed.

## Last Completed Work (2026-05-02)

### BrowserStack a11y plan COMPLETE (goofy-plotting-hartmanis.md — all phases verified)
- **Phase 1**: ARIA role hierarchy fixed — listbox children have `role="group"` + `aria-label`; no duplicate role attributes on autocomplete items
- **Phase 2**: Label-in-Name (WCAG 2.5.3) — 114 close/dismiss/remove × chars wrapped in `<span aria-hidden="true">` across 12 source files; Toggle option labels, community notification labels all fixed
- **Phase 3**: Same-href link text — all 27 unique violations resolved (blog back-links, learning.html emoji, platforms/help/careers/roadmap/documentation links)
- **Phase 4**: Nav dropdown `aria-hidden` initial state — all 48 HTML pages use `inert` attribute on `.nav-dropdown-menu` divs
- **Phase 5**: Color contrast — `--gray-500` darkened to `#4b5563` (7.0:1 on white); all `color: #6b7280` hardcoded instances replaced with `var(--gray-500)`
- **Phase 6**: Images alt text — already complete (all `<img>` tags have `alt=`)
- **Phase 7**: Landmarks — SPA shell `<output>` elements for offline/voice indicators, `<aside aria-label="Chat assistant">` for chat container
- **Target**: BrowserStack score 85 → 92-95 on next scan (all confirmed violations resolved)

## Last Completed Work (2026-05-01 session 3)

### Automations/Webhooks/Supplier UI cleanup batch (commits 18d0ab11 + prior session)
- **[Image #8] Calendar + Performance buttons removed** from Automations page header (keep History only)
- **[Image #7] Scheduler Health dead code removed** — scheduler status API loader + `renderSchedulerWidget` function deleted (element id was never rendered in the automations HTML; pure dead code)
- **[Reports] Supplier Monitoring tab removed** from Reports page tab bar + supplier content branch deleted
- **[Suppliers] Suppliers page hidden on production** — IS_PROD guard added to `suppliers()`: redirects to `#analytics` on non-localhost; matches DEV_ONLY_TABS treatment
- **[Global] Image Vault rename COMPLETE** — parallel session committed 4dcfdd7d→fa49ec24; all Image Bank → Image Vault across backend, frontend, tests, docs, public HTML, comments, nav items, routes, bundle
- **[Image #12] Lookup + Tools buttons removed** from Inventory page header (commit 63f0150d from prior session)
- **Fake-data audit 100% COMPLETE** — 73/73 findings resolved (from prior session)

## Last Completed Work (2026-05-01 session 2)

### UI cleanup batch — landing/settings/checklist/listings/inventory (uncommitted local work)
- **Landing / pricing counts**: landing Coming Soon section now shows exactly 4 cards (Kijiji, Etsy, Mercari, Vinted) and public/app pricing copy uses 7 platforms.
- **Settings integrations marketplace grid**: Integrations now uses the landing/platform page order and compact vinyl-style marketplace cards; browser smoke verified live/coming-soon order and visible region suffixes.
- **Webhooks**: removed the Settings integrations Webhooks card, aliased `#webhooks` back to Settings/Integrations, and rebuilt bundles so the standalone Webhook Management page is hidden.
- **Checklist tabs**: `switchChecklistTab` now refreshes the active page content directly; browser smoke verified Completed tab click updates state and active tab styling.
- **Checklist incomplete action**: registered the shared `square` icon and the "Mark All as Incomplete" button now renders an empty square SVG instead of the unicode placeholder.
- **Connections email cards**: Gmail and Outlook unconfigured states now use Coming Soon copy/styling instead of "OAuth not configured" / "Unavailable".
- **Listings platform prices**: expanded Platform Prices list dedupes by platform while preserving the currently expanded listing for duplicate platforms.
- **Inventory stock badges**: Out of Stock row badges now carry `inventory-stock-out` styling for the faint red highlight.
- **Facebook connect dialog**: rebuilt `dist/chunk-settings.js`; browser smoke verified Facebook shows only manual connect, with no OAuth button/copy/divider.
- **Verification**: `bun run build`, `bun run lint`, `bun run open-items:check`, and targeted Playwright smoke checks pass on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Tracking system audit — 26 flaws fixed (commits f8eadc8e→86cd3081)
- **Flaw 27**: `normalizeForCheck` now strips GitHub Open Issues section — `open-items:check` is deterministic in CI (no longer fails on live issue timestamp changes)
- **Flaw 28**: `open-items-check.yml` watch paths widened to include 5 source files that feed the generator
- **Flaw 33**: Added `labeled` event to `add-to-project.yml` — issues labeled post-creation now added to project boards
- **Flaw 38**: Documented `- [~]` won't-fix convention in `parseUncheckedFile` comment
- **Flaw 39**: Created `docs/reference/env.md` — 83-var reference grouped by required/optional. Resolves R-018 from deep-dive-backlog.
- **Flaw 41**: Confirmed non-issue — `rg` is pre-installed on ubuntu-latest
- **Still manual**: Flaw 34 (renew `ADD_TO_PROJECT_TOKEN` secret), Flaw 40 (pin unpinned action SHAs in 5 workflows — needs `pin-github-actions` tool, not safe to fabricate SHAs)

### Display bug sweep — My Shops, Automations, Image Bank (2026-05-01, commits d75873da→273a1003)
- **Grailed "Coming Soon" fix**: was showing Coming Soon badge despite being a launched platform. Root cause: stale `dist/chunk-deferred.js` in Docker container (built 2 weeks prior, missing LAUNCH_PLATFORMS logic). Fixed by touching `init.js` to change hash, rebuilding all chunks (`bun run build`), and `docker cp` into container. **VERIFIED LIVE 2026-05-01** — production DOM confirms `"Grailed (CA) Not connected Connect"` at `vaultlister.com/?app=1#shops`.
- **`getShopHealthScore` null crash**: accessing `.health_score` on `undefined` when `shops.find()` returns undefined for unconnected platforms. Fixed with `shop ? ... : null` guard.
- **Automations page**: clean — 8 automations render correctly (Grailed/Poshmark/Depop/Facebook/Mercari), no undefined/NaN/placeholder text, all section headings present.
- **Image Bank page**: clean — proper empty state, search input, stats (0 Total/Folders/Tagged), no broken images.
- **Settings handlers**: `saveShopBranding` and `saveMultiShopSyncSettings` wired to real PUT /api/shops/:platform API calls (were state-only). Committed in `273a1003`.

### Hide dev-only Analytics tabs on production (2026-05-01, commit d5426e06→d75873da)
- **Predictions**, **Market Intel**, and **Supplier Analytics** analytics tabs are now hidden on the live site but remain visible on localhost for development.
- Implementation: `src/frontend/pages/pages-core.js` — `IS_PROD` flag (`hostname !== 'localhost'`) merges `DEV_ONLY_TABS = ['predictions', 'market-intel', 'sourcing']` into `hiddenTabs` and `removedAnalyticsTabs` when running in production.
- Bundle rebuilt → committed → Railway forced-deploy (CI watch-path skipping required manual "Deploy commit" each time).
- **VERIFIED LIVE**: `vaultlister.com` shows 6 tabs (Graphs, Heatmaps, Ratio Analysis, Product Analysis, Financials Analytics, Inventory); localhost shows all 9.
- To re-enable a tab on production, remove it from `DEV_ONLY_TABS` in `pages-core.js` and rebuild the bundle.

### Fake-data removal — batches 1–3 + live verification (commits 744a80fd→8016d058)
- F26/F27/F28: budget progress widget and demand heatmap render from real data only
- F33/F34: notification settings read from store state — no more hardcoded checked=true
- F35/F36/F37/F40/F42/F44: syncAllShops, saveRoadmapSubscription, shop health derived from real state
- F49: automation run history shows real API data or empty — removed 6-item mock fallback
- F50: competitor activity refresh calls real /api/market-intel/competitors
- P0-pub-1/P0-pub-4/P1-pub-3/P3-pub-2/P3-pub-5: all VERIFIED LIVE ✅
- P3-pub-11/P3-pub-12/P1-pub-1: search bars + sidebar logo added and deployed

### Task tracking system improvements (2026-05-01)
- 109 fake-data findings promoted from STATUS.md to `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-01-fake-data-audit.md`
- `bun run open-items` regenerated — 74 findings now tracked in `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md`
- `open-items:check` passes — OPEN_ITEMS.md is current
- `.github/stale.yml` — added `automated`, `ci-failure`, `launch-checklist` to exemptLabels
- `.github/workflows/open-items-check.yml` — new CI workflow enforces OPEN_ITEMS.md is never stale

## Top Launch Blockers
1. **CR-4 EasyPost** — ROUTES FUNCTIONAL 2026-05-03 — `/api/shipping-labels/rates` and `/buy` return 403 (CSRF protection, not 503). `EASYPOST_API_KEY` NOT on Railway (verified 2026-05-03 via Variables tab — 93 vars, no EASYPOST). Must be added manually before live verification.
2. **CR-10 OAuth** — ROUTES FUNCTIONAL 2026-05-03 — eBay, Depop, Shopify `/api/oauth/authorize/*` all return 401 (auth required, not 503). Routes exist and respond. Needs real OAuth credentials configured per `docs/reference/cr10-oauth-connect-checklist.md`.

**PRE-EXISTING**
0. Use `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md` as the active task backlog — REMAINING_WORK_EXECUTION_SHEET_2026-04-21.md is historical evidence only.
0. [OPTIONAL] Richer sale path test — sale with non-zero payment_fee + packaging_cost + inventory-linked item; verify all 5 ledger rows fire.
0. [WATCH] Financial regression: (a) no accounting-statement labels reintroduced, (b) new ledger paths don't skip non-zero amounts, (c) no tax schema/copy creep, (d) no duplicate rows on retry/edit.
1. CR-4: EasyPost shipping integration — OPEN / NOT VERIFIED
2. CR-10: Connect flows for remaining platforms — Depop 503, Poshmark/Mercari/Grailed/Whatnot unverified

**TRACKING SYSTEM (remaining flaws to address)**
- Renew `ADD_TO_PROJECT_TOKEN` GitHub secret — project boards not updating (all 3 recent workflow runs failed)
- Add `Fixes #N` commit convention to `.husky/commit-msg` — zero issues linked in 200+ commits
- Slim `docs/open-items/items.json` — promote remaining STATUS.md-class tasks into items.json or walkthrough docs
- Add agent-readable structure to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` files

> Run `git status` for current working tree. Run `bun run open-items:check` to verify OPEN_ITEMS.md is current.
